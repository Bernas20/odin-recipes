    I love this creamy sun-dried tomato chicken dinner that's wonderful for company. Everything is cooked in one skillet, which makes it even better!

<h2>
    Ingredients
</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li> 10 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
    <li> 6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    <li> 1 cup dry white wine (such as Chardonnay)</li>
    <li> 2 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li> 1 ½ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li> 1 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, thinly sliced </li>
    <li> 1 cup thinly sliced fresh basil </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Steps
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and pound to an even thickness. If breasts are very large, cut them in half. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and cook 1/2 of the chicken breasts until they are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from skillet and set aside. Melt another 4 tablespoons butter and repeat with the remaining chicken breasts. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet and add garlic, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Pour in wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, return to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in cream and sun-dried tomatoes. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in basil and return chicken to the skillet. Cook until chicken is thoroughly heated and sauce has thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
